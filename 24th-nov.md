## opened in the upper distribution value area high and simply ran up above pday high into the siingles of the couples of day ago, the moved look like a emotional move without any pullback or tempo loss and immediately turned down and came back down like v shape reversal, made a new day low but we are still iin the higher value zone and NQ is above pday high showing strength compared to ES 

## not sure which one will pull which one
